# Project Plan

<!--TOC max2-->


## Problem Statement
State the business problem statement 

## Value Proposition
Describe the value proposition of the use case.

What value are we delivering to our user/customer/organization?

Who is our customer? What are their pains and gains?

What is the estimated business or monetary value?

## Stakeholders
Describe all stakeholders involved in your use case.

Who are the users? What can you do to help them trust you/your solution?

Who are the buyers and decision-makers? 

Are there saboteurs? Are there influencers and recommenders?

## Model Usage
Describe how the model output is going to be used.

Is it used to automates a decision or process? Or is used for decision support?

Is there human supervision?

What happens if the model makes a mistake?

## Risks
Describe what could go wrong. Are their policy hurdles?

What roadblocks could we face? 

## Data Science Methodology
Problem Statement
Translate the business problem statement into a data science problem statement. Describe the input and output of the machine learning model.

What kind of problem are we trying to solve (classification, regression, optimization, generative, planning, translation)?

### Model
What algorithm are you using/proposing? Why? Advantages? Disadvantages? This is a good place for nerdy details

### Solution Metrics
Describe the one metric you want to optimize and other requirements your model needs to fulfill. What is that one metric?

What is the latency requirement of the model? Memory requirements?

#### Current Solution
Provide the current solution and the metrics: manual entries, 95% accuracy, requires ~1 hour per document.

#### Proposed Solution
How does the proposed solution stack up: automated pipeline, a few seconds per document, initial accuracy 80%.

### Model Evaluation
Explain what the metrics mean: what does a false positive translate to? False negative?

Why are we using F1 score instead of accuracy? What loss function are we using and why.

### Data
Input
Results or Output

### Research
#### Papers
Did you use any papers for inspiration or methods? This could be a support paper as well. 

#### Results
These are some final and key results. Put charts with specific key findings; always include a caption with the takeaway.


## Monitoring and Evaluation
### Initial Tests
What tests are/need-to-be planned? A/B test? How are those results going to be shared? Is there a phantom mode?

### Monitoring
What automated process will be checking for algorithm issues? Are we testing for noncorrelated training and testing? What thresholds indicate a need to shut off the feature/system?
