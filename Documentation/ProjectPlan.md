Data Science Methodology
Problem Statement
State the business problem statement as well as the translation into a data science problem statement

## Solution Metrics
Current Solution
Provide the current solution and the metrics: manual entries, 95% accuracy, requires ~1 hour per document.

Proposed Solution
How does the proposed solution stack up: automated pipeline, a few seconds per document, initial accuracy 80%.

Model Evaluation
Explain what the metrics mean: what does a false positive translate to? False negative?

Why are we using F1 score instead of accuracy? What loss function are we using and why.

Data Model
Input
Results or Output
Research
Papers
Did you use any papers for inspiration or methods? This could be a support paper as well.

Results
This is some final and key results. Put charts with specific key findings; always include a caption with the takeaway.

Model
What algorithm are you using? Why? Advantages? Disadvantages? This is a good place for nerdy details

Monitoring and Evaluation
Initial Tests
What tests are/need-to-be planned? A/B test? How are those results going to be shared? Is there a phantom mode?

Monitoring
What automated process will be checking for algorithm issues? Are we testing for noncorrelated training and testing? What thresholds indicate a need to shut off the feature/system?
